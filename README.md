# TradingSimPro: Modular Trading Strategy Framework

**TradingSimPro** is a comprehensive and modular framework designed to help users simulate and enhance their trading strategies. With a focus on flexibility and scalability, this tool allows you to create, test, and optimize various trading strategies in a simulated environment before applying them to live markets.

## Features

- **Modular Strategy Building**: Easily plug in different trading strategies and combine them into complex systems.
- **Simulation Environment**: Test strategies in a simulated market with historical data or custom market scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze key metrics such as profit, drawdown, risk-adjusted returns, and more.
- **Strategy Optimization**: Automatically optimize strategy parameters for better performance.
- **Backtesting**: Quickly backtest strategies using historical data to evaluate performance.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the simulation and strategies to your specific trading style and needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for web components)
- Python 3.x (for simulation and strategy modules)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TradingSimPro.git
   cd TradingSimPro
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install  # For the web-based components
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For the Python simulation modules
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run start  # For launching the web interface
   python simulate.py  # To start running simulations
   ```

## Usage

1. **Define Your Strategy**:
   Create or import your trading strategy as a modular component. You can define entry and exit signals, risk management rules, and more in the `strategies/` folder.

2. **Run Simulations**:
   Test your strategy using either the built-in market data or import your own. Customize the market environment to replicate different scenarios (bullish, bearish, volatile, etc.).

3. **Analyze Results**:
   After running the simulation, review key performance metrics and optimize your strategy using parameter tuning to improve profitability.

4. **Deploy to Live Trading**:
   Once your strategy performs well in simulations, you can deploy it to your live trading setup using broker APIs (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers).
